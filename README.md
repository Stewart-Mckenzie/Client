## My Portfolio Website
This is my portfolio website! I am going to use it to showcase all the creations I am proud of and chronicle part of my process in creating them.

## Motivation
I have always foud outerspace awe inspiring so I wanted to create a 3D experience that captures a bit of that feeling and then use it as a back drop for my portfolio to sort of given depth to the web interface and my projects aswell.

This is a huge inspiration:
